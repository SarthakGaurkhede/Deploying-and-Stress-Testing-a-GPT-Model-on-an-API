# Deploying-and-Stress-Testing-a-GPT-Model-on-an-API
The objective of this task is to deploy a heavy GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model of the size of 3-4 GB on an API, create basic tasks for the GPT as API calls, and then stress test the deployed model by simulating 10 concurrent users making requests to the API.
